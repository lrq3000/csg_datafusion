# TODO

* Implement [EdieViz](https://github.com/Edinburgh-LTG/edieviz) to do natural language processing on radiological reports (eg, as in dicom files)? But risk of leaking private info.
* Implement [OCRmyPDF](https://github.com/ocrmypdf/OCRmyPDF) as a first pass to make badly scanned PDFs readables?
